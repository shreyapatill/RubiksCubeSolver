This is a Python 3 implementation of a (3x3) Rubik's Cube solver.

It contains:

- A simple implementation of the cube
- A solver that follows a fixed algorithm
- An unintelligent solution sequence optimizer
- A decent set of test cases

## Installation

The package is hosted on PyPI.

```sh
pip install rubik-cube
